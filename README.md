# linguatron
Prototype of an app for speaking words when a user draws a symbol, which are entirely user-defined! Useful for all non-vocal people.

To use, just go to super-fluid.github.io/linguatron. Note that this prototype does not perminantly store your data! If you reload the page, your work will be lost. If you want me to make a version suitable for long-term use, let me know (contact info at super-fluid.github.io).
