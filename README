LING 229 final project, spring 2016
"Linguatron"

To view the project, just open "demo.html" in your browser.
An internet connection is required so it can download jQuery.

I gathered my training data with "training.html", which works the same way.
It asks the user to send me an email with the collected data.

When you first open demo.html, it's not trained. 
To train it, open the JavaScript console and enter:

train(25);
or 
alpha_train(2);

You can vary the number of iterations if you like.

"reset()" throws away the training.

To perform an automated test, there are three options:

"dev_test()" runs the development test.
"final_test()" runs a test with a distinct data set.
"alpha_test()" runs a test I created with a larger vocabulary.

The tests do not use or modify the stored vocab.

To perform an informal manual evaluation, you'll need some vocabulary.
You may enter it yourself, or load the large vocabulary that was used
in alpha_train with "load_vocab()".

Erase all the stored symbols with "clear_vocab()".
