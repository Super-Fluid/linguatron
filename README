LING 229 final project, spring 2016
"Linguatron"

To view the project, just open "demo.html" in your browser.
An internet connection is required so it can download jQuery.

I gathered my training data with "training.html", which works the same way.
It asks the user to send me an email with the collected data.

When you first open demo.html, it's not trained and works poorly. 
In the JavaScript console, try:

test();
-> 
train();
test();
-> 

"devtest()" runs the development test.
"longtest()" runs a test I created with a larger vocabulary.
"reset()" throws away the training.

Separate from the training, which sets the weights of the features
and language model, you can load some symbols with "load_vocab()" and
erase all the stored symbols with "clear_vocab()".

Note that "test()" etc do not use anything in the stored vocab.
