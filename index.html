Thanks for helping with my linguistics 229 final project!
 I'm making a system that lets you select words by drawing symbols, where you create
 all the symbols yourself. It's designed as a way to communicate for people who have trouble speaking.
 <br><br>
 In order for the algorithm to work well, I need training data: a set of symbols
 that people create and later attempts to draw the same symbols. The next page will ask you to draw the symbols that
 you would use to stand for some words. Then it will ask you to recreate the
 same symbols from memory a few times. The whole process will take about 3 minutes. 

<br><br>
Use symbols that make sense to you. Keep them simple and fast.
